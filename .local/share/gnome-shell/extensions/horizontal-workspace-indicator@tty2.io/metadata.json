Left button click: move to left, right click: move right. Middle click calls overview.\nThere are options to customize look of the widget, check settings for that.\nTo apply changes turn the widget off and on again.\nIf your indicator looks different from one on screen shot, install DejaVu Serif or Ubuntu font.",
